			<p>Sound Thief is the first of a series of mini-documentaries featuring independent musicians based in four cities. This one features Jivraj Singh, drummer for Pinknoise, and designer/ producer. Born to parents who lived life on the road and made music, music was not so much a glamorous externality as much as a way of life for Jivraj. Watch us as we talk to him about his personal experiences and how they've impacted his music, as well as show you a lesser known musical fascination of his."</p>
